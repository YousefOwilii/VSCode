I'm building up the strength
But lately, I been weak as ever
It's scary to admit
That this could be the end for forever
I'm losin' all my hope
It's harder when the end gets closer
I'm scared of letting go
I'm scared of movin' on, gettin' older

Baby
I know we're not perfect
It don't mean it's not worth it
Don't give up on us
And maybe
We're not meant to be, but
How we supposed to know if
If we give up on love?

'Cause heartbreak never leaves
It lingers in your mind, in your thoughts at night
And every time you're sleepin'
It haunts you in your dreams 'til the mornin' light
And heartbreak isn't easy
Maybe it's the hardest thing I've done
'Cause heartbreak never leaves
Said, heartbreak never leaves

And, baby
I know we're not perfect
It don't mean it's not worth it
Don't give up on us
And maybe
We're not meant to be, but
How we supposed to know if
If we give up on love?

Hayaati
Ente wardat snenee
Roohy w3omery w naseeby
Ente noor al koon
Hayaati
3omery wrohy fedaki
Ente hoby w hanany
Don't give up on us
